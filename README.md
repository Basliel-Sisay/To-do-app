To-do-app: A Modern Todo List Application 📋


A sleek and intuitive Todo List application built with Webpack, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project showcases modular front-end development, local storage for data persistence, and a user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks efficiently. 🚀


📋 Project Overview
To-do-app is a single-page application (SPA) designed to help users create, update, and delete tasks with ease. Leveraging Webpack's module bundling, it provides a modern development workflow with hot-reloading, optimized builds, and a clean codebase. The app persists tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring data remains intact across sessions. Perfect for learning Webpack or building a lightweight task manager! 🛠️


🎯 Learning Objectives
This project demonstrates:

🔹 Webpack Configuration: Setting up module bundling, dev servers, and production builds.
🔹 Front-End Development: Modular JavaScript with ES6, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
🔹 Data Persistence: Using localStorage for lightweight, client-side storage.
🔹 UI/UX Design: Responsive, accessible interface with clean CSS styling.
🔹 Software Best Practices: Organized code structure, version control, and build automation.
🔹 Task Management Logic: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.

Core Components
1. Application Logic (src/js/app.js)

Manages task CRUD operations and orchestrates UI/storage interactions.
Uses event listeners for user actions (add, edit, delete, filter).

2. Storage Module (src/js/storage.js)

Handles localStorage operations for saving and retrieving tasks.
Serializes tasks as JSON with unique IDs.

3. UI Module (src/js/ui.js)

Renders task list and updates DOM dynamically.
Implements responsive layouts and animations.

4. Webpack Configuration (webpack.config.js)

Bundles JavaScript modules and CSS.
Configures development server with hot-reloading.
Optimizes production builds with minification.

5. Styling (src/css/style.css)

Uses CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts.
Applies modern design with hover effects and transitions.

🚀 Build & Usage
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16+ recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

Installation
bashgit clone https://github.com/Basliel-Sisay/To-do-app.git
cd to-do-app
npm install
Basic Usage
bash# Start development server (with hot-reloading)
npm start

# Build for production (outputs to dist/)
npm run build

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser (auto-launched by npm start).
Add tasks via the input field.
Edit tasks by clicking their descriptions.
Delete tasks or clear completed tasks with buttons.
Filter tasks using the "All," "Active," or "Completed" options.

Running Tests
bashnpm test
Note: Testing setup is under development. Future versions will include Jest or Mocha for unit tests.
