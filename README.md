<h1>To-do-app: A Modern Todo List Application 📋</h1>


A sleek and intuitive Todo List application built with Webpack, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project showcases modular frontend development, local storage for data persistence, and a user friendly interface for managing daily tasks efficiently. 🚀


<h2>📋 Project Overview</h2>
To-do-app is a single page application (SPA) designed to help users create, update, and delete tasks with ease. Leveraging Webpack's module bundling, it provides a modern development workflow with hot reloading, optimized builds, and a clean codebase. The app persists tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring data remains intact across sessions. Perfect for learning Webpack or building a lightweight task manager! 🛠️


<h2>🎯 Learning Objectives</h2>
This project demonstrates:

🔹 Webpack Configuration: Setting up module bundling, dev servers, and production builds.<br>
🔹 Front-End Development: Modular JavaScript with ES6, DOM manipulation, and event handling.<br>
🔹 Data Persistence: Using localStorage for lightweight, client side storage.<br>
🔹 UI/UX Design: Responsive, accessible interface with clean CSS styling.<br>
🔹 Software Best Practices: Organized code structure, version control, and build automation.<br>
🔹 Task Management Logic: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.<br>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/Basliel-Sisay/To-do-app.git
cd to-do-app
npm install
</pre>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<pre>
# Start development server (with hot-reloading)
npm start
</pre>
<pre>
# Build for production (outputs to dist/)
npm run build
</pre>
1. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser (auto-launched by npm start).<br>
2. Add tasks via the input field.<br>
3. Edit tasks by clicking their descriptions.<br>
4. Delete tasks or clear completed tasks with buttons.<br>
